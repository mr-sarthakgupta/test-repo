add different text under each image in inline list with link

As I said in the title I need to add a different text under each image
these images are contained in a list and displayed as inline

so I need to keep both image and text connected to the same link.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japanâs major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

Students will examine works of art from the Waltersâ collection and explore the stories of explorers throughout history and the cultural exchanges that took place between Europe and other regions of the world as a result of travel, trade, and colonization.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (thatâs four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

Well, according to moderator Tom Cain, that is. But we have to agree it was pretty darn important. Experts in the smart grid industry gathered to talk about the roadblocks and strategies for the smart grid, and how vital it is to get it up and running nationwide as soon as possible. Click through to hear their talk.The panel included some serious players in the industry. From left to right, moderator Tom Cain, Managing Partner of Sail Venture Partners, Mossadiqu Umedaly, Chairman of BC Hydro, Bill Vogel, CEO of Trilliant, Scott MacDonald, Partner of Emerald Technology, and Eric Dresselhuys, VP and Co-founder of Silver Spring Networks.

Debate on whether or not start-ups can work in the smart grid sphere, and the impact of the stimulus package.

The panel noted that utilities are big beasts and you want them to be very prudent and have reliable systems, so they have to know their suppliers will be there for the long term and have integrated systems. Because of this, the start-ups have a hard time selling individual components to utilities. But the thing is, the smart grid is so new that most all the companies in the industry are fairly small start-ups. Larger organizations get more attention because of their perceived stability, but start-ups also need acknowledgment.

There's tremendous room for innovation in this stage, including a huge opportunity for small companies, vevnture capitalists, and everyone else. Innovation is definitely wanted by utilities but the responsibility of providing power is so serious that innovation is taken with trepidation.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japanâs major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

Imagine that you are setting out on a journey to a strange new land. What will you bring with you? What do you think you will find? Students will examine works of art from the Waltersâ collection and explore the stories of explorers throughout history and the cultural exchanges that took place between Europe and other regions of the world as a result of travel, trade, and colonization.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (thatâs four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!
