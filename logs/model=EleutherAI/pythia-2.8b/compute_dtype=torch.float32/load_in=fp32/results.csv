Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?

string to byte[] array

ok i know this has been beat to death but i can't seam to get all the ones on google here or anyplace to work 
i have a string that looks like this
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

i store this string
each digit has a range from 0 to 254 and the string is almost random
i need to convert this to a byte array because of a hardware
change
this is what the hardware is looking for 
hardware.command(DeviceID, byte[]);

i tested the  hardware by doing this
hardware.command(1, new byte[] { 0, 0, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38,",204,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

  ","<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Q:

Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?
function switcher(x){
const letters = {

...and she only became a BB contestant because of her associate with Giggs.

No she didn't but she wasn't very memorable as a BB contestant except for original siding with the resident bitch in the house that year - Grace double barrelled something and then crossing over to the other faction the moment she was kicked out - she might have a house romance too I really can't remember. She was Miss Wales in some capacity too before then.

laravel, How to update array in json column?

in my Laravel app, the database has a column named ""mavads"" as :
{
  ""en"": [
    {
      ""need"": ""enn1"",
      ""amount"": ""enm1""
    },
    {
      ""need"": ""enn2"",
      ""amount"": ""enm2""
    },
    {
      ""need"": ""enn3"",
      ""amount"": ""enm3""
    },
  ],
  ""ru"": [
    {
      ""need"": ""run1"",
      ""amount"": ""rum1""
    },
    {
      ""need"": ""run2"",
      ""amount"": ""rum1""
    },
  ]
}

This is the form that send data as PUT to the controller to update the database:

@foreach($food->mavads['en'] as $m)
      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""enneed[]"" value=""{{ $m['need'] }}"">
      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""enamount[]"" value=""{{ $m['amount'] }}"">
@endforeach

@foreach($food->mavads['ru'] as $m)
      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""runeed[]"" value=""{{ $m['need'] }}"">
      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""ruamount[]"" value=""{{ $m['amount'] }}"">
@endforeach

the Food Model:
  protected $casts = [
    'mavads' => 'array'
  ];

in Controller, I get $request and want to update each { ""need"": ""run2"",""amount"": ""rum1""} of en or ru languages:
    $enmavad = $request->only('enneed', 'enamount');
    $rumavad = $request->only('runeed', 'ruamount');
    $food->mavads = [""en"" => $enmavad, ""ru"" => $rumavad];

but I get the error and no correct update

Many situations exist where signal interference between multiple wireless devices degrades the performance of one or more of the devices, based on signal strengths and/or the physical proximity of the devices.
For example, in the home, signals from a microwave oven, cordless phone, and wireless access point often interfere with each other. Depending on the relative strengths of the signals (i.e., weaker signals introduce less interference) and/or physical separation between the devices (i.e., signals weaken as the distance between the devices increases), the interference results in a slow download, the inability to communicate with a Web server, or a “bad” phone connection (i.e., unable to clearly hear the other party).
In some situations, the interference may be of little consequence, though annoying to most users. However, there are situations, such as those dealing with the wireless communication devices used by public safety personnel, where the interference has potentially problematic consequences, particularly when working in a hazardous environment.
For example, a police officer typically uses a two-way radio for communicating with a dispatcher or other officers on the same digital radio frequency. These digital radio communications are subject to interference by other wireless devices (e.g., cell phones, vehicular subscriber modems, etc.) that operate on nearby spectrum blocks, when the officer is near to these wireless devices. In such a situation, the officer's time-sensitive communications may become unclear, completely garbled, or delayed.

Hello.

We are DWG consultants. We are a full service team of skilled engineers, qualified support staff (and some serious Batkid enthusiasts).

We are breaking free from the engineers stereotype. That's right, we pull out our USB drives without removing safely.

Don't react...listen.

Why do we call ourselves consultants? It's simple. An engineer responds to input from the client. But a consultant asks intelligent questions and draws upon a depth of professional experience to make decisions for the client – bringing answers and smart solutions to the table, not more questions.

We're people people. We thrive on communication and interaction, specifically those of the fun(ny) variety.

Theory of relational awesomeness between DWG and client.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

It's simple:love where you work.

We believe a team that has fun together works well together. And a team that works well together produces amazing work.

We foster collaboration and exploration through our use of cutting edge technology. We design using state of the art workstations and software, focused on Revit (and we play a mean game of Minesweeper).

Let's meet.

If you’re still reading, that means you’re falling in love with DWG, which means we should talk. Maybe it’s about a project, maybe it’s about a career, or maybe it’s just about why engineers love acronyms so much. Whatever the reason, give us a call or drop us a line…we’d love to meet.

Cipières () is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in southeastern France.

Cipieres is about 50 minutes drive from the French Riviera, and is an unspoilt medieval village of around 500 inhabitants. There are two restaurants, a pizzeria and a general store. Sheep are farmed on the surrounding mountain side and a farm sells lamb direct and also makes a renowned goats cheese. There is an annual free rock festival (Ciprock) as well as a homemade kart race through the narrow streets, attracting children as well as some more serious adults.

It enjoys a beautiful climate and has far reaching views across the valley of the wolf to the peak of Mount Cheiron, with the village of Greolieres in the foreground.

I'm wanting the code to search in outlook for what is in cell E2 and post the received date in cell H2, then search in outlook for what is in cell E3 and post the received date in cell H3 and so on.
I thought I had it working for a while, but it now just posts in the first cell only (H2). Also the format seems all over the place.
Any help would be much appreciated.

A:

There is no loop to walk through the values in column E. Another For ... Next loop involving i should be sufficient.

User.created_at_after(DateTime.now - 3.days).created_at_before(DateTime.now)

I've followed the solution explained here Rails extending ActiveRecord::Base but when I execute the rails console and try to call the methods I get an undefined method error.
Here's my code:
# config/initializers/active_record_date_extension.rb
require ""active_record_date_extension""

# lib/active_record_date_extension.rb
module ActiveRecordDateExtension
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do |base|
    base.columns_hash.each do |column_name,column|
      if [""datetime"",""date""].include? column.type
        base.define_method(""#{column_name}_after"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} > ?"", date)
        end
        base.define_method(""#{column_name}_before"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} < ?"", date)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
Rails.application.eager_load!

ActiveRecord::Base.descendants.each do |model|
  model.send(:include, ActiveRecordDateExtension)
end

What am I doing wrong?

A:

Using Rails 4.1.9 and Ruby 2.2.1, I noticed a few issues with the code above.

You are comparing column.type with strings, and Rails returns symbols for that attribute.
base.define_method is trying to call a private method, you can get around that with send

This is the tweaked code
module ActiveRecordDateExtension
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do |base|
    base.columns_hash.each do |column_name,column|      
      if [:datetime, :date].include? column.type              
        base.class.send(:define_method, ""#{column_name}_after"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} > ?"", date)
        end
        base.class.send(:define_method, ""#{column_name}_before"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} < ?"", date)
        end
      end

How to stream DTMF tones through my HEADPHONES?

kind of new to android. I have an app up and running, I am producing DTMF signals and interpreting what is generated with a micro controller. I am successfully generating the tones, but the tones are being played through the speaker and I want to play the tones through a spliced headphone jack (so even after the solution, I need to override android's desire to switch to the speaker when it thinks no headphones are there). Thanks in advance. The code is here..

Rajendra Agarwal (R), 53 years, Pune Income: Rs 5 lakh a year. Includes profit from business, house rent, capital gains and interest. Form used: ITR 4 for self, ITR 2 for parents and HUF. Our assessment: A knowledgeable taxpayer who understands the various deductions and tax-saving strategies, Agarwal is using the online facility to the hilt. All four returns are mailed to the Centralised Processing Centre in one envelope by speed post Ashwani Jain is feeling as if a load has been lifted off his shoulders.

Please find below the testimonials on our tax filing tool of last year. ""This was a breeze and fantastic. I hope all systems are made so easy and convenient so that everybody complies with their civic responsibilities. "" - C. Ramachandran (GM, Biomedical Engineering), CARE Convergence Center, Hyderabad ""I have used your tool and would like to say that it is finest online tool for preparing ITR for individuals...

It may be the beginning of the era of filing paperless returns - anytime and from any place. No longer is there a need to stand in long queues. Filing returns may become an easy and simple exercise. July 31 is the last date for filing income tax returns for individuals, Hindu Undivided Families, and other non-corporate assessees. Taxpayers have started preparing themselves for the yearly ritual of poring over their documents and making hurried calls to their chartered accountants . Though e-filing of returns is not compulsory for individual taxpayers, it has picked up in a big way because of the convenience it offers.

Never ask a man his wage and a woman her age is an adage often quoted but not one that your taxman upholds. Yet again, it's that time of the year when you are required to disclose the details of your income and file income-tax returns. To make this pocket-pinching process a non-taxing job, SundayET lists down six steps which you can follow to sail through. Do you need to pay tax? This year, the income-tax department has made revisions with regard to tax slabs and exemptions.

Discover how the Walters comes alive at night! Every Thursday from 5-9 p.m., you can wander the galleries, see special exhibitions for FREE, eat in our café and find the perfect gift at the museum store.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

Assigning functions to buttons created in a for loop in Tkinter

I have a for loop which creates an amount of buttons (in tkinter) based on the length of my list, compkeys. When I make each button, it is given a previously made function which takes one input. I am trying to make the input of the function specific to the iteration of the for loop. For example, the first button that is created in the loop should have the first item in the list comp keys as input in its function. 
However, each button is only receiving an input of the final value of x, instead of the value of x depending on how many times the loop has repeated. Thank you for any and all help:)
import tkinter

compkeys = [2017onsc, 2017onwat]

for x in range(len(compKeys)):
    compButton = Button(root, text = compKeys[x], command=lambda: compBuDef(compKeys[x]))
    compButton.place(x=x * 100 + 200, y=300)

A:

You must pass the parameter through the lambda function:
for x in range(len(compKeys)):
    compButton = Button(root, text=compKeys[x], command=lambda z=compKeys[x]: compBuDef(z))
    compButton.place(x=x*100+200, y=300)

or better, iterating over elements:
for idx, ckey in enumerate(compKeys):
    compButton = Button(root, text=ckey, command=lambda z=ckey: compBuDef(z))
    compButton.place(x=idx*100+200, y=300)

The key word in the constitution is 'unreasonable'. To me, even the active pursuit of a drug user, using in his own home, outside the purview of public safety, is never reasonable. It goes beyond the role of peace officers. At the same time, i feel all drug use laws are on their face unconstitutional. The tenth amendment restricts federal power to those explicitly given in the constitution. All other powers are to be at the state level. If a state want's to make pot illegal, they can.. but it is unconstitutional for the federal government to do so.

Completely agree. As long as we are not directly harming someone else, what we do in the privacy of our own homes should not be allowed to attacked by government agents.

Victimless crimes is an oxymoron. These are laws that take away our freedoms, create criminals out of otherwise decent citizens and make it so that crime pays very well for those on the top of the criminal food chain. Prohibition proved what victimless laws do to enhance major crime elements. Remove the crime and you remove the criminal element and everyone except organized crime is better off.

...seek, and ye shall find;..

So always seek the Truth, not just what you want to believe to be true…

Backup script to FTP with timed subfolders

I want to make a backup script, that makes a .tar.gz of a folder I define, say fx /root/tekkit/world 
This .tar.gz file should then be uploaded to a FTP server, named by the time it was uploaded, for example: 07-10-2012-13-00.tar.gz
How should such backup script be written?
I already figured out the .tar.gz part - just need the naming and the uploading to FTP.
I know that FTP is not the most secure way to do it, but as it is non-sensitive data, and FTP is the only option I have, it will do.
Edit:
I ended up with this script:
#!/bin/bash

# have some path predefined for backup unless one is provided as first argument
BACKUP_DIR=""/root/tekkit/world/""
TMP_DIR=""/tmp/tekkitbackup/""
FINISH_DIR=""/tmp/tekkitfinished/""

echo ""Backing up dir ... $BACKUP_DIR""
mkdir $TMP_DIR

exit

# start backup using lftp and script we created; if all went well print simple message and clean up 
lftp -f lftp.upload.script && ( echo Upload successfull ; rm lftp.upload.script )

A:

First you create cron job that is invoked at time you want to have backup created
after backup is created script will generate lftp script to upload file via FTP.

Re: Weekly Shonen Jump [2012] - Discussion and TOC Talk - Part 4

Well I think Naruto fans got Kishi's hidden message in chapter 607 and are slowly losing interest. I wonder if Kishi really will be able to drag Naruto out for 1.5+ years now because Naruto's popularity is in a decline atm. It might end up below in Bleach in rankings soon.

Re: Weekly Shonen Jump [2012] - Discussion and TOC Talk - Part 4

It mentions in that ad that this is indeed the story Togashi wrote 10 years ago that never got made, and is the basis for the movie. The characters in there are the Kurta clan, and it basically gives Kurapika's origin story. It'll appear in two issues for a total of 63 pages. It's called the ""Kurapika Memory Arc"" (クラピカ追憶編). Doesn't mention anything about the series restarting.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (that’s four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking",512,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

awk handling special chars while capturing text between two patterns

I have the following line of awk code in my script which searches text between start and end patterns from logs.
Logs look similar to:
[zzzz] Static WEB3
[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] end-pattern

OR could be
[zzzz] Static WEB1 :: WEB2 :: WEB3
[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] end-pattern

Awk script:
awk ""/\[zzzz\] Static ${VAR3} / || /${VAR1} :: ${VAR2} :: ${VAR3} /{flag=1;next} /end-pattern:/{flag=0}flag"" /tmp/error.log 

I got these errors:
01:18:35 awk: cmd. line:1: /\[zzzz\] Static WEB3 / || /WEB1 :: WEB2 :: WEB3 /{flag=1;next}           /end-pattern:/{flag=0}flag

I don't understand why I get the above syntax errors from awk, while the above code executes perfectly on my local machine (ubuntu 16.04, with bash GNU bash, version 4.3.46(1)-release).
I also tried using \ before : to escape however I get a different issue.

How to build a compile-time key/value store?

I have a problem where I need to map an integer at compile time to another integer. Basically, I need the compile-time equivalent of std::map<int,int>. If a key is not found in the map, I'd like to return a default value.
The interface I'd like to use:
template<unsigned int default_value,
         unsigned int key0, unsigned int value0,
         unsigned int key1, unsigned int value1,
         ...>
struct static_map
{
  ...
};

template<unsigned int key, typename StaticMap>
struct lookup
{
  static unsigned int value = ...
};

lookup returns the value associated with key in the StaticMap. If key is not found, then default_value is returned.
In general, the number of key/value pairs will be bounded by some limit > 2. What is the best way to build static_map and lookup?
I should also mention that I'm limited to using C++03 language constructs, so no C++11, and no external library dependencies.

Here's the solution I arrived at, inspired by n.m. and DyP's answers below:
#include <iostream>

template<unsigned int k, unsigned int v>
struct key_value
{
  static const unsigned int key = k;
  static const unsigned int value = v;
};

template<typename Head, typename Tail = void>
struct cons
{
  template<unsigned int key, unsigned int default_value>
  struct get
  {
    static const unsigned int value = (key == Head::key) ? (Head::value) : Tail::template get<key,default_value>::value;
  };
};

template<typename Head>
struct cons<Head,void>
{
  template<unsigned int key, unsigned int default_value>
  struct get
  {
    static const unsigned int value = (key == Head::key) ? (Head::value) : default_value;
  };
};

template<unsigned int default_value,
         unsigned int key0, unsigned int value0,
         unsigned int key1, unsigned int value1,
         unsigned int key2, unsigned int value2,

Hide and display select option based on other select value

I have this form with a few select dropdowns and based on what we select, we display and hide other dropdowns. When I select the value All then the geo select reacts to the selected value, but when I select the value Test the function family select doesn't disappear. Any reason why?
I also need to assign the value of the function family to 0 when the Test is selected. Help would be appreciated. 
The main select:
<select name=""scope"" onchange=""javascript:sync_scope()"">
                            <option value=""1"">All </option>
                            <option value=""10"">Test</option>
                        </select>

Javascript:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" ) ? ""block"" : ""none"";     
      document.form.function_family.style.display = ( scope == ""10"" ) ? ""none"" : ""block"";

    }

The HTML
 <select name=""geo"">
    <?php foreach ($geos as $geo) : ?>
        <option value=""<?php echo $geo['id']; ?>""><?php echo utf8_encode($geo['name']); ?></option>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</select>

<select name=""function_family"" id =""function_family"">
<option value=""0"" <?php selected($function_family, 0); ?>>All functions</option>
<?php foreach ($functions as $function) : ?>
    <option value=""<?php echo $function['id']; ?>""><?php echo utf8_encode($function['name']); ?></option>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</select>

A:

Your if condition is wrong in the second option:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" ) ? ""block"" : ""none"";     
      document.form.function_family.style.display = ( scope == ""10"" ) ? ""none"" : ""block"";

    }

should be:

                                        November 13, 2002

Before JONES, STEWART and DENNIS, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM:*

       Felipe Zaragoza appeals the district court’s denial of his motion to reduce or eliminate the

restitution order imposed by the district court as part of his sentence. Zaragoza’s motion was

unauthorized and the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. The appeal is therefore

dismissed as frivolous.         APPEAL DISMISSED.

Great in theory, we should get our answers soon. Though you got to ask, if it was possible, wouldn't the forerunners still be around if they had a convenient thing to keep them alive from the flood.

Shield Worlds like Onyx were designed to protect the inhabitants within from the Halo Array's firing, and the worlds within the micro-dyson spheres are massive in scope.

A gift! Whatever. I find this one to be annoying in just about every way, but it's expert attention whoring, and I suppose I have fallen for it by making it an IotD.

What I do with my own unit, I also consider to be art. It's just not for public display.chrisinhouston Sunday Jul 30 09:54 AM

Yea but is it art???

My wife and I were in Aruba a few years ago and attended an artist show that was coupled with the first tasting of that year's Nouveau Beaujolais (November as I recall). Kind of a wild cocktail party for the sake of art.

This definitely brings that to mind.

Well, according to moderator Tom Cain, that is. But we have to agree it was pretty darn important. Experts in the smart grid industry gathered to talk about the roadblocks and strategies for the smart grid, and how vital it is to get it up and running nationwide as soon as possible. Click through to hear their talk.The panel included some serious players in the industry. From left to right, moderator Tom Cain, Managing Partner of Sail Venture Partners, Mossadiqu Umedaly, Chairman of BC Hydro, Bill Vogel, CEO of Trilliant, Scott MacDonald, Partner of Emerald Technology, and Eric Dresselhuys, VP and Co-founder of Silver Spring Networks.

Debate on whether or not start-ups can work in the smart grid sphere, and the impact of the stimulus package.

The panel noted that utilities are big beasts and you want them to be very prudent and have reliable systems, so they have to know their suppliers will be there for the long term and have integrated systems. Because of this, the start-ups have a hard time selling individual components to utilities. But the thing is, the smart grid is so new that most all the companies in the industry are fairly small start-ups. Larger organizations get more attention because of their perceived stability, but start-ups also need acknowledgment.

There's tremendous room for innovation in this stage, including a huge opportunity for small companies, vevnture capitalists, and everyone else. Innovation is definitely wanted by utilities but the responsibility of providing power is so serious that innovation is taken with trepidation.

This ostentatious patriotic pose is part of the industry’s cynical PR campaign to convince you and me that its assault on our health, water, air, and economic future should be mindlessly saluted, rather than questioned.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

Analyze the validity of the following reasoning without using truth tables

I have to decide whether the following reasoning is valid or not:
$$\{\neg p\Rightarrow [(\neg s\Rightarrow \neg r)\;\wedge\;(\neg s\vee t)]\;\wedge\;\neg t\}\quad\Rightarrow\quad p.$$
I have no idea how to prove it. I tried different ways but I'm stuck.
For example, I separated it on premises:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
P_1:&\neg p\Rightarrow [(\neg s\Rightarrow \neg r)\;\wedge\;(\neg s\vee t)] \\
P_2:&\neg t
\end{array}$$
$\neg t$ must be $T$, so $t$ must be $F$. But by replacing its truth value in $P_1$ I can not assure anything of $p$. On the other hand, if I try to reduce the proposition, it does not give me guarantees of anything over $p$.
What demonstration method should be used? And how would you prove it without using truth tables?
Thanks!

A:

You can do this using the 'short truth-table method'.
The idea here is that you try to see whether or not the statement can be false, and so, let's see what has to be the case when the statement is false. As such, we'll put $F$ under the main connective:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land&\neg &t&\}&\rightarrow &p\\
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&F\\
\end{array}
A conditional can only be false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land&\neg &t&\}&\rightarrow &p\\
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&T&&&&F&F\\
\end{array}
For the conjunction to be true, both conjuncts need to be true:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land",512,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

add different text under each image in inline list with link

As I said in the title I need to add a different text under each image
these images are contained in a list and displayed as inline
and connected to a link.
so I need to keep both image and text connected to the same link.
I tried this method but the images appear in the form of a vertical list.

a, figure {
    display: inline-block;

Discover how the Walters comes alive at night! Every Thursday from 5-9 p.m., you can wander the galleries, see special exhibitions for FREE, eat in our café and find the perfect gift at the museum store.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (that’s four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

He only uses water-based paints and sells his paintings for around A$300 (US$250).

Patch says the road to becoming a prolific artist is a rough one.

""There is a limit to how long one can paint for, especially on canvas,"" he said on his Web site.

He adds that taking his work seriously helps him from getting too excited.

""I take the performance very seriously. It is entertainment,"" he said on his website. ""Erotic, yes, but non-sexual. It's a gift, it's art.""

A gift! Whatever. I find this one to be annoying in just about every way, but it's expert attention whoring, and I suppose I have fallen for it by making it an IotD.

What I do with my own unit, I also consider to be art. It's just not for public display.chrisinhouston Sunday Jul 30 09:54 AM

Yea but is it art???

My wife and I were in Aruba a few years ago and attended an artist show that was coupled with the first tasting of that year's Nouveau Beaujolais (November as I recall). Kind of a wild cocktail party for the sake of art.

Anyway the renowned local artist had an unusual style for producing his big canvases. He would paint the body of a young nude woman and then she would roll on the canvas leaving paint to produce the art. Let me just say that abstract puts it mildly!

This definitely brings that to mind.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

add different text under each image in inline list with link

As I said in the title I need to add a different text under each image
these images are contained in a list and displayed as inline
and connected to a link.
so I need to keep both image and text connected to the same link.
I tried this method but the images appear in the form of a vertical list.

a, figure {
    display: inline-block;
}
figcaption {
    margin: 10px 0 0 0;
    font-variant: small-caps;
    font-family: Arial;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #bb3333;

}
figure {
    padding: 5px;
}


img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
    -ms-transform: scale(1.1);
    -webkit-transform: scale(1.1);
    -moz-transform: scale(1.1);
    -o-transform: scale(1.1);
}
img {
    transition: transform 0.2s;
    -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 0.2s;
    -moz-transition: -moz-transform 0.2s;
    -o-transition: -o-transform 0.2s;
}



.photos{
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: center;

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses.

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

If You Do have a Brick and Mortar Shop, and would like to get these signs in your store, or you need eggstra inventory for your craft shows, These signs sell. I can ship lots of signs in a flat rate box to save money, and extra discount off large orders.

Or you can come to my studio near College Station,Tx and pick up your order.

Got them listed on my etsy for sale, but if you would like to order and pay with your credit card, I process with the square card reader.

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!
